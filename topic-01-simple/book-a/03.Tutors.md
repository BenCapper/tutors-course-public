1. Open the Git Bash terminal and type the following command: (This will take a couple of minutes, don't worry if it seems stuck.)

  ~~~
  npm install tutors-ts -g
  ~~~

2. When the installation completes you will see a line similar to this: (Although the version number may differ)

  ~~~
  + tutors-ts@3.3.0
  ~~~

3. Generate a template course by typing the following command into the Git terminal: (This generates a folder named **tutors-starter-0** which contains the sample files to be replaced with your own later)

  ~~~
  tutors-ts --new
  ~~~

  ![Path to tutors-starter-0](img/25-path.png)

4. The command to change directory is **cd (option)** use this to navigate into the tutors-starter-0 folder. (Git Bash uses **Users** -> **Your Name** as its root directory.)

  ~~~
  cd tutors-starter-0
  ~~~

5. Now enter the following command, which generates the course website content from the file structure within **tutors-starter-0** and populates a new folder named **public-site-uk**.

  ~~~
  tutors-ts
  ~~~
