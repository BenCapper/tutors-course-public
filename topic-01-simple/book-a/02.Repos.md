You will notice a **.git** folder has appeared. This folder links the **tutors-starter** folder to the remote repository it was cloned from. We must break this link so you can connect it to your own remote repository.

# Create a New Remote Repository

1. Navigate back a folder to **This PC** -> **Boot** -> **Users** -> **Your Name** and drag the **tutors-starter** folder, into the **GitHub Desktop** application.

2. As the folder is not linked to a remote repository, you will be prompted to **Create a New Repository**. Select this link:

3. Enter tutors-course-public as the repository name and select **LOOKUP**

You now have a file structure stored in a remote repository on GitHub which will be used by Netlify to generate and deploy the course website. 

In the next step you will set up Netlify and make a change to the website. The site will be automatically updated as you push changes made on your local machine to the remote repository on GitHub, as you did in the previous step.
