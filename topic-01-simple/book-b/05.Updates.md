# Making Changes

1. For any change to take effect, you must open GitHub Desktop and enter a summary of your changes with an optional description.

2. Press `Commit to main`. This will push updates from your local machine, into staging, ready to be pushed into the remote repository.

4. Netlify will automatically update your website with the changes pushed to the remote repository.

5. Open your course site in a browser and refresh the page. This may take ~30 secs, hold the `Shift` key and refresh the page to clear the page cache.
