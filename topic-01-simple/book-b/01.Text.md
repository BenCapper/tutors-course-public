# Text

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [insert a link to Google](http://google.com)

## Lists

To use `numbered lists`, just number your list:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

~~~
1. One
2. Two
3. Three
~~~

To use `bullet points`:

* Start a Line With a Star
- Or a Dash!

~~~
* Start a Line With a Star
- Or a Dash!

## Images

If you want a link to a local image, place the image in the `img` folder and then insert a link like this:

![](img/02.jpg)

~~~
![](img/02.jpg)
~~~

Alternatively you can directly link to images on the web, and include an image title:

# Structured documents

Sometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

# This is a first-tier heading
## This is a second-tier heading
### This is a third-tier heading
#### You get the picture..

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.

~~~
# This a first-tier heading
## This is a second-tier heading
### This is a thrid-tier heading
#### You get the picture..
~~~

To use `quote formatting`, use the `>` character before the line:

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.
> - Captain Janeway

There are many different ways to style code with Markdown. Inline code blocks can be wrapped in backticks: `var example = true`:

~~~
`var example = true`
~~~ 

If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:

    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }

GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

~~~
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
~~~
~~~
~~~
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
~~~
~~~

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

~~~javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
~~~
