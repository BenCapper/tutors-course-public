3. Take note of the `ignorepin` section. This allows you to hide course content from students. To show the folder, simply enter the pin on the frontpage of your course site.

4. In this example, the pin is `1111`. If `1111` is typed into the keyboard while on the frontpage of the website, and while the site is your current window, the hidden course content will be enabled.
