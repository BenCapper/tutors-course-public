# Properties.yaml

1. Navigate to the `properties.yaml` file in your sites root directory (`tutors-starter` folder)

2. Edit the `credits` section to include your name.

3. Take note of the `ignore` and `ignorepin` section. These allow you to hide course content from students. To show the folder, simply enter the pin on the frontpage of your course site, or remove the folder name from the `ignore` section.

4. In this example, the pin is `1111`. If `1111` is typed into the keyboard while on the front page of the website, and while the site is your current window, the hidden course content will be enabled.

# Lab File Names

1. Lab file names and titles control the output displayed in breadcrumbs and lab pages. See the following image to see how these correspond:

    ![Comparison](img/compare.png)

2. The correct syntax for a filename is `2 digits` - `YourWord` - `.md`:

    ~~~
    00.Markdown.md
    ~~~

3. The filename controls the breadcrumb output at the lab level, while the file title controls the page title on the sidebar and in the page content itself.
