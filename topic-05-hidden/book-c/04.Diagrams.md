2. Press `Ãˆnter` and notice the code block with a `Select a Language` box.

### Sequence Diagram

You can create `Sequence Diagrams`  by entering `sequence` as the diagram language:

(See [here](https://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams/#syntax) for a detailed syntax explanation)

```sequence
Alice->Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Note right of Bob: Bob thinks
Bob-->Alice: I am good thanks!
```

```
Alice->Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Note right of Bob: Bob thinks
Bob-->Alice: I am good thanks!
```

### Flowchart

You can create `Flowcharts` by entering `flow` as the diagram language:

(See [here](http://flowchart.js.org/) for a more detailed syntax explanation)

```flow
st=>start: Start
op=>operation: Your Operation
cond=>condition: Yes or No?
e=>end

st->op->cond
cond(yes)->e
cond(no)->op
```



~~~
```
st=>start: Start
op=>operation: Your Operation
cond=>condition: Yes or No?
e=>end

st->op->cond
cond(yes)->e
cond(no)->op
```
