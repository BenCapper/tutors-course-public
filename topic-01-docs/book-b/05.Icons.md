# Changing Card Icons

1. Navigate to [Iconify](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/).

2. These are packs of icons which are fully compatible with Tutors. Select the pack you want to use.

3. Then select the icon which you want to use:

    ![Logo Icons](img/rhicon.png)

4. This opens the icon details section. Copy the icon name:

    ![Red Hat Icon](img/rhdeets.png)

5. Open `course.md` or `topic.md`, then copy this template into the top of the file, above the title, and replace `logos:redhat-icon` with the icon name from Iconify:
    ~~~
    ---
    icon:
      type: logos:redhat-icon
    ---
    ~~~

6. Some icons can be changed colour:
    ~~~

    icon:
      type: heroicons-outline:book-open
      color: black
