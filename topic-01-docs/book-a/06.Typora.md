# Typora

<span style="color: red">This step is **optional**. If you are happy using Sublime, continue to the next step.</span>

<span style="color: red">Be Aware:</span> Typora is currently free while in Beta testing, however this will change with the release of the official version.

Some features of Typora are not currently compatible with Tutors but are being integrated over time. These are the additional functionality mentioned below.


Typora adds additional functionality to the Markdown notation, such as `Highlighting`, `Diagrams`, `Maths`, `Emoji's`, and `Diagrams`. Unlike other editors, Typora is a Markdown only editor, meaning other files such as `properties.yaml` cannot be edited with this application.

However, Typora is unique, allowing the user to view how the content they are writing in Markdown will look through a browser, as they write it. This greatly reduces the time required for testing page formatting.

To view the code which is in effect, just click the area which has been formatted. For example: `Be Aware` is red due to a `<span>` tag, click the effected area to see the `<span>` tag which is in effect.
